    """
    Implements a cooling schedule based on the adaptive schedule developed by:
    Huang, M.D., Romeo, F., Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, A.L., 1986.
    An efficient general cooling schedule for simulated annealing,
    In: Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on
    Computer-Aided Design, Santa Clara, pp. 381â€“384.

    This cooling schedule will slow down the cooling rate as the variance of
    the energy increases, and speed it up if the variance decreases.

    This cooling schedule is designed to work in environment where samples
    are accumulated asynchronously. When the algorithm is stepped it takes a
    temperature and energy of a sample and then makes an incremental weighted
    adjustment to the current temperature. Samples from temperatures very
    different from the current temperature, but close in time, are weighted
    low, while temperatures that are close to the current temperature are
    weighted highly. These energies are used to estimate the heat capacity
    of the system, which is then used by the referenced cooling schedule to
    update the temperature.
